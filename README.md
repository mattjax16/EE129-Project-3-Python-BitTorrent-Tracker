# EE129-Project-3-Python-BitTorrent-Tracker

A lightweight BitTorrent tracker implementation with persistent state management.

### Why This Tracker?

This project was created as an easy way to set up a private BitTorrent tracker for distributing torrents while maintaining 
an extra layer of privacy. While no one should be able to access a torrent without its corresponding `.torrent` file, 
using a private tracker ensures that peers only communicate through a controlled environment, without relying 
on the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) or public trackers. This makes it useful for cases where you want to share 
torrents securely while avoiding unnecessary exposure to public networks.


### What I Learned

While building this tracker, I gained a deeper understanding of networking concepts, particularly in 
implementing application-layer protocols. The BitTorrent protocol itself requires handling structured 
peer communication through HTTP-based announce requests and responses. Additionally, I had to implement 
techniques like:
- ***Bencoding:*** A unique encoding format used by BitTorrent for serializing data efficiently.
- ***SHA-1 Hashing:*** Used to generate and verify torrent info hashes, ensuring data integrity.
- ***State Management & Persistence:*** Keeping track of peers, torrents, and session data while ensuring that state is preserved across restarts.

## Features

### Tracker Server
- ‚úÖ Peer announcements (`/announce`)
- üìä Torrent statistics scraping (`/scrape`)
- ‚ûï Torrent metadata registration (`/add_torrent_info`)
- üíæ State persistence to disk (JSON format `tracker_state.json` by default)
- üîç Similar hash detection (first 10 and last 5 characters by default with ability to adjust tolerances)
- üßπ Automatic peer cleanup (30-minute inactivity window by default)

### Client Script
- üìÅ Torrent file parsing (.torrent)
- üîó Info hash calculation with custom URL encoding
- üìã Metadata extraction (name, size, creation date, etc.)
- üîÑ Retry mechanism for failed requests (3 attempts)
- üì¶ Batch processing of multiple torrent files


## Requirements

```
flask
bencodepy
requests
```



## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mattjax16/EE129-Project-3-Python-BitTorrent-Tracker.git
   cd EE129-Project-3-Python-BitTorrent-Tracker
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   
## Tracker Usage
### Starting the Tracker
```bash
python tracker.py
```
Server runs on http://localhost:6969 by default

Tp shut down the server, use `Ctrl+C` and it will save the state (what torrents its tracking and their peer lists) automatically to `tracker_state.json`.

## Configuration

### 1. Tracker (tracker.py)

The main tracker file contains several important configuration variables that control its behavior:

```python
# Network Configuration
IP = '0.0.0.0'  # Interface to bind to
PORT = 6969     # Port number for the tracker

# Timeout Settings
PEER_TIMEOUT = 1800  # 30 minutes in seconds

# Hash Matching Configuration
HASH_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.95  # 95% similarity threshold

# State Management
DATA_FILE = "tracker_state.json"  # State file location
```

#### Variable Descriptions

1. **Network Configuration**
   - `IP`: 
     - Default: '0.0.0.0'
     - Purpose: Determines which network interface the tracker binds to
     - Options:
       - '0.0.0.0': Listen on all interfaces
       - '127.0.0.1': Listen only on localhost
       - Specific IP: Listen on a specific interface

   - `PORT`:
     - Default: 6969
     - Purpose: The port number the tracker service listens on
     - Note: Should be open in firewall if using remote connections
     - *This is the standard port for bittorrent trackers*

2. **Timeout Settings**
   - `PEER_TIMEOUT`:
     - Default: 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
     - Purpose: Time after which inactive peers are removed
     - Impact: Affects peer list cleanup and resource usage
     - Considerations:
       - Lower values: More aggressive cleanup, less memory usage
       - Higher values: Better peer persistence, more memory usage

3. **Hash Matching Configuration**
   - `HASH_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`:
     - Default: 0.95 (95% similarity)
     - Purpose: Controls how strictly torrent hashes are matched
     - Impact: Affects torrent deduplication and identification
     - Settings:
       - Higher values (0.99): Stricter matching, fewer false positives
       - Lower values (0.90): More lenient matching, possible false positives

4. **State Management**
   - `DATA_FILE`:
     - Default: "tracker_state.json"
     - Purpose: Where tracker state is saved and loaded from
     - Format: JSON file containing all tracker state
     - Considerations:
       - Use absolute paths in production
       - Ensure write permissions
       - Consider backup location


### 2. Torrent Info Script (add_torrent_info.py)

The script for adding torrents to the tracker has several configuration variables:

```python
# Tracker Configuration
TRACKER_DEFAULT_URL = 'http://localhost:6969'
TRACKER_ENDPOINT = '/add_torrent_info'

# Encoding Settings
ENCODING = 'utf-8'
DEFAULT_CREATED_BY = 'Torrent Tracker Script'

# Error Handling Configuration
MAX_RETRIES = 3
RETRY_DELAY = 2  # seconds

# File Processing Configuration
CHUNK_SIZE = 8192  # bytes for reading large files
SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = ['.torrent']

# HTTP Request Configuration
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 30  # seconds
HTTP_HEADERS = {
    'User-Agent': 'Torrent-Tracker-Client/1.0',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

#### Variable Descriptions

1. **Tracker Configuration**
   - `TRACKER_DEFAULT_URL`:
     - Default: 'http://localhost:6969'
     - Purpose: Base URL for the tracker
     - Can be overridden via command line argument
   
   - `TRACKER_ENDPOINT`:
     - Default: '/add_torrent_info'
     - Purpose: API endpoint for adding torrent information
     - Used in conjunction with TRACKER_DEFAULT_URL

2. **Encoding Settings**
   - `ENCODING`:
     - Default: 'utf-8'
     - Purpose: Character encoding for torrent metadata
     - Used when decoding torrent file strings
   
   - `DEFAULT_CREATED_BY`:
     - Default: 'Torrent Tracker Script'
     - Purpose: Default value for created_by field
     - Used when torrent file lacks this information

3. **Error Handling Configuration**
   - `MAX_RETRIES`:
     - Default: 3
     - Purpose: Number of attempts to add a torrent
     - Impact: Affects reliability vs speed tradeoff
   
   - `RETRY_DELAY`:
     - Default: 2 seconds
     - Purpose: Wait time between retry attempts
     - Helps prevent overwhelming the tracker

4. **File Processing Configuration**
   - `CHUNK_SIZE`:
     - Default: 8192 bytes
     - Purpose: Buffer size for reading large files
     - Impact: Memory usage vs read performance
   
   - `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS`:
     - Default: ['.torrent']
     - Purpose: List of valid file extensions
     - Used for initial file validation

5. **HTTP Request Configuration**
   - `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`:
     - Default: 30 seconds
     - Purpose: Maximum time to wait for tracker response
     - Prevents indefinite hanging on slow connections
   
   - `HTTP_HEADERS`:
     - Default: User-Agent and Content-Type headers
     - Purpose: HTTP request metadata
     - Identifies client and specifies JSON content
